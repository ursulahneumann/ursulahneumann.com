Hi and welcome! I currently work as a Senior Scientist @ [Pawsperity Biotechnologies](pawsperitybio.ca), \
an early stage startup working on improving animal health through biomarker discovery.  


I received my PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of British Columbia \
studying diabetes in 2017.  Since then I have focused on improving my data anlysis and \
machine learning skills. In my free time I love to explore Vancouver's trails, \
practice yoga, and take pictures of flowers ([@bloomvancouver](https://www.instagram.com/bloomvancouver/)).
