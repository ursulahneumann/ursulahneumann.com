### Pistachio Cardamom Shortbread Cookie Recipe
Used this [link](https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/pistachio-shortbread-cookies/) as a base, have only tried half recipe (with modifications) but it works. I used less pistachios because it just seemed like a lot and we only had so many.  Have tried with and without cardamom.  The first time I made it, it was quite crumbly, so the second time I added ½ tsp of milk.  It was significantly more moist and less crumbly, may have also been like this because I weighed the butter instead of trying to cram it in the ½ cup (so I may have underestimated the butter in the first batch).

Makes: 11 – 13 cookies

### Ingredients
* ½ cup butter (or 115 g which is easier to measure when it’s hard), at room temperature
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ½ tsp pure vanilla extract
* 3.5/4 cups all purpose flour
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* ¼ cup pistachios (without shells)
* 1/8 tsp powdered cardamom

### Steps
1.	Cream the butter and the sugar together.
2.	Beat in the vanilla.
3.	Whisk together the flour, cornstarch and cardamom. Blend them into the butter and sugar, until it forms a dough.
4.	Stir in the pistachios and make sure you get them well distributed in the dough.
5.	Turn the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a log (I made the end square shaped which was easier than round when it was crumbly), about 5 inches long. Wrap it in the plastic and smooth it into a uniform smooth shape.
6.	Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours, or overnight. (I did 1 hour in fridge and 15 min in freezer since I was impatient).
7.	Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
8.	Slice the dough into 1/4 -1/3 inch slices and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Thinner slices will bake up crispier, and thicker ones will be more buttery and soft.  This half recipe makes 11 - 13 cookies)
9.	Bake for about 10-11 minutes, maybe a little longer for thicker cookies. The cookies will still be pale and soft, but will firm up as they cool.
10.	Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet, then cool completely on a rack.

### Things to try
* Adding a pinch of salt (although I think the butter we used was technically salted)
* Many recipes with pistachios and cardamom also had rosewater
