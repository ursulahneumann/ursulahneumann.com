### Passionfruit Margarita Recipe
Makes 1 cup (which fits in the special glasses we have).

### Ingredients
* 1/8 tsp chili powder
* 1/8 tsp salt 
* 1/4 cup On The Rocks Hornitos Margarita mix (20% alcohol) 
* 1/8 cup lime juice (about 1 lime)
* 1.5 tbsp [passionfruit syrup](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01GQK3AB8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) 
* 5/8 cup sparkling water

### Steps
1)	Mix chili powder and salt.
2)	Rub a lime over the rim of the glass.
3)	Swirl rim in chili salt
4)	Mix margarita mix, lime juice, and syrup then top with sparkling water.


### Notes
* Ends up being 5% alcohol in the end.  
* The premade margarita mix is more expensive than getting each ingredient individually but easy if you only want a small amount for a special occasion.
* The flaky salt is too large to stick to the rim.  I used a small amount of regular grained salt and it worked well, made sure to not use too much in case it was too salty.
