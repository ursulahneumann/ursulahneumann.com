### Cornbread without Buttermilk Recipe

Based on this recipe https://stateofdinner.com/cornbread-without-buttermilk/. <br>
I wanted to find a recipe without buttermilk since it's a less common ingredient.

### Ingredients
* 1 cup fine yellow cornmeal
* 1 cup all-purpose flour 
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ½ cup butter, melted and cooled slightly, 115 grams
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1 cup whole milk, room temperature
* 1 egg room temperature
* 1 tablespoon butter (for pan)

### Steps
1)	Turn on oven to 400°F (200°C).
2)	Mix dry ingredients in a medium bowl.
3)	Melt butter in microwave in 15 second increments (let cool slightly if hot).  Add honey and whisk. Add milk and egg and whisk.
4)	Mix wet into dry.  Don't overmix.  There might be some clumps.  
5)	Heat cast iron pan on stove on high for 2.5 minutes.
6)	Drop 1 tablespoon of butter into the pan. Spread the melted butter to coat the bottom of the pan.
7)	Pour the batter into the skillet and smooth it with a spatula. Bake for 20 min, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
8)	Serve with a bit of honey on top.

### Notes
* The skillet will start smoking if it gets too hot while warming.  
* The batter is quite thick but it worked out.
* The original recipe said bake for 20-25 min but 20 worked for our oven and it was starting to brown and had a crust.
* It was a bit crumbly and not that sweet but we liked it.  Buttermilk or higher % fat milk might make it less crumbly. 
* Keep in the fridge for 3 days or freezer for 3 months.
