### Chex-Mex Recipe
[Original recipe](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/chex-mix/) is for 13 cups so have halved the recipe for 6 cups so it fits on the oven tray (even though it's actually 46%) so air on the side of underfilling.

### Ingredients
* 6 cups of cereal (see note)
* 1 tsp seasoned salt
* 0.75 tsp garlic powder
* 0.5 tsp onion powder
* 1/8 tsp paprika
* ¼ cup butter (57 g)
* 1.5 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

### Steps
1.	Turn oven to 120°C or 250°F
2.	Mix dry ingredients
3.	Melt butter in microwave
4.	Add Worcestershire and dry ingredients to melted butter and mix
5.	Pour mixture over cereal while tossing
6.	Bake for 1 hour mixing every 20 minutes

### Notes
* I used plain Cheerio's and Shreddies; recipes often call for plain rice or corn Chex as well for cereal.  Non-cereal ingredients can also be used such as nuts, pretzels, or crackers.  
* Best if used in 2-3 days although says good for 2-3 weeks in air tight container.
