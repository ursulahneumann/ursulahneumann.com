### Almond Bark Recipe

### Ingredients
* 680 g white chocolate (2 x 340 g package, see note)
* 1.5 cup Cap'n Crunch cereal
* 1.5 Rice Krispies cereal
* 1.5 cup mini marshmellows
* 1.5 cup dry roasted peanuts

### Steps
1. Melt chocolate in a double broiler (melt slowly so it doesn't burn)
2. In a large bowl, mix other ingredients.
3. Add melted chocolate slowly and blend well.
4. Drop a tsp on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. Freeze.
6. Put in a bag or container and keep frozen or in the fridge until use.

### Notes
*   Must use white chocolate that actually melts.  Mom uses Sweet Tooth Fairy Meltables found at Michaels.
