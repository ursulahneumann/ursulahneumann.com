### Breakfast Cookie Recipe
Makes: 16 cookies

### Ingredients
* 1 banana mashed
* 3/4 cup peanut butter
* 1/4 cup butter (57 g)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* Up to 1.5 cups/24 tbsp mix-ins (dried cranberries, white chocolate chunks, chocolate chips, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, etc.)
* 2 cups of quick oats (may use slightly less)

### Steps
1. Preheat overn to 350°F (180°C).
2. Mix banana, peanut butter, butter, vanilla, and maple syrup.
3. Add in mix-ins.
4. Add in oats.  May require less than 2 cups (have used 1.75 cups in the past) based off how dry the mixture seems/how big banana was/etc.
5. Roll into 16 small sized cookies.
6. Cook for 16 min.

### Notes
*   Use a mix of peanut butter and butter since 100% peanut butter was too peanut buttery.
