Note: For hugo version 0.112 or later.

e.g.
- `hugo new content recipes/test_recipe`
- `hugo new content blog/test_blog`

These will look in the `archetypes` folder for an appropriate named bundle
(folder) and create a new subfolder in that website section accordingly.

See [lookup order](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/#lookup-order).
